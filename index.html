        <p class="lead pt-3">In the mid 19th century first-generation toymaker Mr Hignett created a variety
          of
          high-quality pieces.
          His proudest moment came when he was asked to build a play carriage for Queen Victoria's children.
          His passion for carpentry has been shared through
          four generations of the family and is still alive today.</p>

  <section id="richard">
    <div class="container text-center">
      <h2 class="fix font-weight-bold pb-4"><u>Richard Hignett and Sons</u></h2>
      <div class="row pb-3">
        <div class="col-md-7 d-flex align-items-center">
          <p class="paragraph">Founded in 1906, Richard Hignett and Sons. became a respected rocking horse maker in
            Merseyside.
            Richard (second-generation) made a number of rocking horses for children to ride on while at sea with the
            P. and O. liners. In
            addition, he crafted dummy bodies for saddlery factories - on which to try saddles for size. Believe it or
            not, one of Richard's creations found its way onto the ill-fated Titanic and remains at a depth of 12,500
            feet.
            <br><br>
            Richard passed on his skills to sons James and John throughout the 1930's and the business continued to
            operate
            before and after the Second World War. The brothers learned that making a good-quality rocking horse is a
            labourious process and is something that will last not just a lifetime, but several. Each horse has a
            different head and its own character. Timber has to be chosen carefully and is expensive.

      <div class="row pb-3">
        <div class="col-md-7 d-flex align-items-center">
          <p class="paragraph">Around a century after his great-grandfather retired James Hignett
            (fourth-generation) built his first
            rocking horse aged 11. Learning from his father (James) he became skilled at producing great pieces. After
            graduating from Keele university in the 1980's he decided to re-establish the family business, using the
            skills and designs passed down to him as well as the tools of his forebearers.<br><br>
            In 1984 James opened what was believed to be the only rocking horse "factory" in the Potteries at the
            Gladstone Pottery Museum, Longton. As the only surviving carpenter in the family some rocking horses could
            take up to a month to craft. One of his favourite horses was on display at a U.S. Air Force base in
            Ipswich for a period. Unfortunately for the rocking horse world, James has since switched careers.
